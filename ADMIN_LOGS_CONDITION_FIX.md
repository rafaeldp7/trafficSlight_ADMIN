# Admin Logs Condition Fix

## Problem
Gas station deletions were logging to admin logs, but other operations (reports, trips, motors) were not. This was inconsistent behavior across the application.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the **logging condition** used across different controllers:

### What's Correct ✅
- `authenticateAdmin` middleware sets `req.user` with these fields:
  ```javascript
  req.user = {
    id: admin._id,
    email: admin.email,
    role: admin.role,
    roleInfo: admin.getRoleInfo(),
    permissions: admin.getRoleInfo().permissions
  };
  ```
- Notice: **NO `isAdmin` boolean field**

### What Was Wrong ❌
Some controllers were checking for `req.user?.isAdmin`, which **doesn't exist**:

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - This will always be false
if (req.user?.isAdmin) {
  await logAdminAction(...);
}

// ✅ CORRECT - This checks if user exists and has an ID
if (req.user?.id) {
  await logAdminAction(...);
}
```

## Controllers with Different Conditions

### ✅ Gas Stations (Working)
- **Condition:** `if (req.user?.id)` ✅
- **Status:** Already correct
- **Why it worked:** Checks for user ID, which exists when authenticated

### ❌ Reports (Not Working)
- **Before:** `if (req.user?.isAdmin)` ❌
- **After:** `if (req.user?.id)` ✅
- **Lines fixed:** 162, 228

### ❌ Trips (Not Working)
- **Before:** `if (req.user.isAdmin && req.user?.id)` ❌
- **After:** `if (req.user?.id)` ✅
- **Lines fixed:** 178, 246

### ✅ Users (Working)
- **Condition:** `if (req.user?.id)` ✅
- **Status:** Already correct

### ✅ Motors (Working)
- **Condition:** `if (req.user?.id)` ✅
- **Status:** Already correct

### ✅ Admin Management (Working)
- **Condition:** `if (req.user?.id)` ✅
- **Status:** Already correct

## Changes Made

### 1. reportController.js
```diff
- if (req.user?.isAdmin) {
+ if (req.user?.id) {
    await logAdminAction(req.user.id, ...);
}
```
**Lines changed:**
- Line 162: Report update logging
- Line 228: Report delete logging

### 2. tripController.js
```diff
- if (req.user.isAdmin && req.user?.id) {
+ if (req.user?.id) {
    await logAdminAction(req.user.id, ...);
}
```
**Lines changed:**
- Line 178: Trip update logging
- Line 246: Trip delete logging

### 3. motors.js (Routes)
Added missing restore route:
```javascript
router.put('/restore/:id', authenticateAdmin, motorController.restoreMotor);
```
**Line 15 added**

## How authenticateAdmin Works

The `authenticateAdmin` middleware (in `backend/middleware/adminAuth.js`) sets:

```javascript
req.user = {
  id: admin._id,           // ✅ Use this for ID
  email: admin.email,
  role: admin.role,
  roleInfo: admin.getRoleInfo(),
  permissions: admin.getRoleInfo().permissions
};
```

**There is NO `isAdmin` boolean field!**

If you need to check if user is admin, check the role:
```javascript
// Check role level
if (req.user.roleInfo?.level >= 50) { // admin or higher
  // do something
}

// Or check specific permission
if (req.user.permissions?.['permission_name']) {
  // do something
}
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Fixed report update logging condition
- [x] Fixed report delete logging condition  
- [x] Fixed trip update logging condition
- [x] Fixed trip delete logging condition
- [x] Added motors restore route
- [x] No linter errors
- [ ] Test creating report and verify log
- [ ] Test updating report and verify log

- [ ] Test deleting trip and verify log
- [ ] Test motor management operations and verify logs

## Summary

The issue was **inconsistent logging conditions** across controllers:

- ✅ Gas stations, users, motors, admin management: Correct condition (`req.user?.id`)
- ❌ Reports, trips: Wrong condition (`req.user?.isAdmin` or `req.user.isAdmin`)

**Solution:** Changed all to use `if (req.user?.id)` which checks for the actual ID field that exists when authenticated via `authenticateAdmin` middleware.

## Next Steps

1. Test the fixed operations (reports, trips) and verify they now log
2. Check backend console for: `✅ Admin action logged successfully`
3. Verify admin logs scene shows entries for all operations
4. Monitor for any remaining inconsistencies
